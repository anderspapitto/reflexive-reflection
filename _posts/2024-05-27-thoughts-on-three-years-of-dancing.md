title: "Thoughts on three years of dancing (mostly Lindy Hop)"
categories:

I've been dancing for just about three years as I write this (September 2021 -
September 2024). That has mostly been in and around San Francisco, and mostly
partner dances. I started with and am most comfortable with Lindy Hop, but I've
been branching out since the last 12 - 18 months.

These are some of my assorted impressions and thoughts. It's definitely not
anything comprehensive, and almost certainly wrong in ways I don't realize yet.

I have some thoughts on the dances themselves, especially in comparison to each
other, and then some thoughts on the surrounding environment that are mostly
less dance-specific.

## Mistakes

I'm going to state a lot of things as facts instead of cramming every single
sentence with qualifiers, but this is definitely not 100% accurate, and probably
nowhere close. If I'm wrong/confused/misrepresenting something that you know
better than me (not hard!), get in touch and let me know.

## The dances themselves (and especially how they differ)

Some things to consider about various dance styles are

### Music
What sort of music are they danced to? What tempo range? Are there other
particular characteristics of the music that are reflected in the movement?

### Connection
What kinds of connections are used? how much frame is required?

### Shape
How do partners move relative to each other on a large scale? I.e. how would the
dances look if each dancer were represented just by their center of mass? How
much do they travel? Is there linear momentum? Is there angular momentum?
Within each dancer and/or across the partnership?

### Body parts
What parts of the body are being danced with? Are some parts more functional and
other parts more expressive?

### Basic step
Is there a basic step? How good is it?

### Pulse
Do the dancers pulse/bounce, or do they glide? What sort of pulse?

### Lead/Follow emphasis
How much of what happens in the dance is lead and followed?

### Skill requirement
How much skill is required for people to enjoy the dance?

### Related dances
Are there other dance styles closely associated with this one? Is this dance
style itself already a result of combining other dances? (hint: yes)

### Showiness
Does the dance emphasize dramatic, flashy movements? Are the creative choices
more subtle? To what extent is it meant to be watched vs meant to be danced?

## So, let's look at some of those

### Music
#### Tempo
from high to low, in general and with lots of overlap:
- balboa
- shag
- charleston, solo jazz
- lindy, house
- west coast swing, fusion
- blues

#### Time period
- balboa, shag, charleston, lindy, blues are usually danced to music > 50 years old
- house, west coast, fusion are usually danced to music < 50 years old

#### Miscellaneous
- lindy triple steps depend pretty heavily on the swung rhythm (in "1 and 2",
  "and" is closer to "2" than it is to "1", and that's reflected in the timing
  of the footwork). None of the other dances have this dependency.
- jazz music is often live, and itself contains improvisation, which means
  that your dancing can't rely on knowing exactly what's coming.
- jazz music has common drum/bass breaks/solos, which can be pretty terrifying
  to beginners because they provide much less accessible structure to the dancers.
- west coast swing and fusion are regularly danced to music that doesn't have
  much rythmic emphasis, e.g. I've heard the term "lyrical" songs used.
- west coast swing is often danced in half time for some slower sections of the
  song. In lindy this would be a bit odd, because triple steps would no longer
  be swung (full beats are evenly spaced)

### Connection
#### Distance
One basic way to look at this is how close the connection is. From furthest to
closest:
- beginner wcs
- lindy, charleston, shag
- advanced wcs,
- balboa, blues, fusion

Basic beginner patterns in wcs spend a lot of time at two arms length, and even
with the torsos angled away from each other - it's basically impossible to get
further than that. More advanced wcs supplements that with a variety of holds on
the torso, upper arms, neck, and with more time spent in the middle rather than
the ends of the slot. In comparison, lindy introduces side-by-side position
immediately but doesn't add as many new upper body connections with higher
skill.

Balboa has a very close but "functional" chest-to-chest connection, which is
being used to communicate rapid footwork/rhythm/momemtum. In contrast, close
connections in blues, and especially in fusion, can be less about mechanical
functionality and more like emotional hugs.

#### Frame
In terms of frame and rigidity of the upper body, it might be something like
- wcs, shag
- lindy, balboa
- blues

Shag is fast and can have many sudden shifts, so a lot of frame is required to
keep the partnership responsive.

Wcs needs frame for a different reason. It's much slower, but there's often a
need to lead and follow turns and foot-specific weight transfers from relatively
static positions, using just a single hand-to-hand connection - that only works
if that single hand is pretty tightly connected to the torso.  It also can
require that the hands be wider apart than in the other dances.

In contrast, lindy and balboa use more momentum for some things (like turns)
that are more frame-based in wcs.

#### Miscellaneous
- wcs uses far more variety of connections (in terms of which parts of the bodies
  are in contact) than the other dances, and in a more improvised way. The
  relatively slow and static baseline makes it more reasonable to take a handful
  of counts to explore some new radius-to-tricep connection in a way that would
  be impossible while rock-stepping past each other at 50% higher bpm.
- in bal-swing, partners are continually oscillating between compression and
  tension (i.e. every two counts), even while doing "nothing" in closed
  position.
- One consequence of this is that quite a few things in balboa (for
  example, tossouts and outside free turns in lollies, or transitioning between
  pure bal and out-and-ins) can be lead mostly by the *absence* of a redirection.
- Related to that point, in lindy (and wcs) tension and compression generally
  ramp up gradually to some peak, and then drop off gradually back to zero (e.g.
  during a sugar push, compression peaks at the moment of redirection, but is
  smoothly ramping up and down around that point). In contrast, for those
  release-based moves, bal-swing has tension/compression that builds smoothly to
  a peak, and then instantly drops to zero.
- in bal-swing out-and-ins, the lead's right hand can float off of the follows
  back during compression (compression happens with the other hand)
- in wcs, in closed position the lead's right hand is much further up the
  follow's back, in the armpit. This allows the follow to continue to
  sink/stretch away with the hips during e.g. the anchor.
- lindy tends to use the highest amount of tension relative to all of the others
- a fast lindy circle is the only motion I've encountered that has a very
  noticeable amount of centripetal/centrifugal force. Note that e.g. a wcs
  "ride" is circular and uses tension, but is substantially different in that
  the tension comes from the partners shifting their weight away from each other
  (i.e. counterbalance), but not from the partners accelerating around their
  shared center.

### Shape
Lindy involves a lot of rebounding off of endpoints, mostly linear, and mostly
tension-based. Canonically in open position, both partners rock step away from
each other on one, resulting in rebounding towards and then past each other (to
the next stretch).

Bal-swing has a cycle of tension and compression every two counts(!) This can be
linear, as in the out-and-in basic, or it can be rotational, as found in
lollies. In balboa (bal-swing as well as pure bal) the partnership as a whole is
often gradually rotating, orbiting one partner or a common center (in addition
to rotation/twisting within each dancers' body - so there are two levels of
rotating-ness in balboa)

West coast swing is linear, like lindy, but has a convention of having not just
individual movements be linear, but actually all of those linear movements are
lined up on a single slot. It's also much more stop-and-start (but smoothed
out). There are posts and anchors that define a relatively static
breathing/recovery space between patterns.

For example, imagine repeated inside turns/passbys/left-side passes. In wcs, the
endpoint of the movement away from each other is defined on count 4 (the post),
and the max stretch is reached on count 6 (at the end of the anchor). In lindy,
the endpoint of the movement is defined on count 6 when tension starts to build,
and the max stretch is on count 1 of the next passby. The movement past and away
from each other is spread more evenly across the entire available 6 counts.

Wcs tends to have more angled torsos, especially for follows (as part of them
being more statically settled in on one side or the other) in open position.

Pure bal and shag both tend to have the partnership drifting across the floor as
a unit, though shag is much more mobile/covers more ground.

Blues and fusion tend to be more in place, relatively more concerned with
movement within the bodies than movement of the bodies within the space.

Charleston (generic charleston? non-20's charleston? not sure of the
terminology) can also be quite rotational, but without the oscillating
compression-tension of balboa. If you watched from above, charleston might look
a bit like watching cogs or gears spinning around each other.

House dance can include substantial amounts of floorwork.

### Body parts
One differentiator is the emphasis on footwork. From high to low, I would say
- pure balboa
- lindy, shag, house, solo jazz
- wcs, bal-swing
- blues, fusion

Another is how much dancing is done with the torso (e.g. body rolls)
- house, wcs, fusion
- blues, solo jazz
- lindy, shag, balboa

In wcs, it's much more common than e.g. in lindy to see leads with both feet
planted for substantial lengths of time, and follows are often explicitly
committed to sinking into one side or the other through lead/follow mechanics.
In contrast, in lindy, each dancer's legs are generally their own business and
more often available for footwork variations.

On the other hand, because wcs is less heavily led on counts 3 and 4, and
because the dance is more stationary, it seems that there is more opportunity
especially for follows more torso movements/level changes/etc, which might be
harder in lindy with higher bpm/more pulse/more momentum/more likelihood of
redirection in those middle counts.

In terms of dancing with the arms, of course the partner dances all have less
emphasis than the solo dances, because arms are often being used for connection.

In (solo) house dance, arm movement is interesting because it's very present but
relatively subtle - there is often continuous and flowy arm movement, but
relatively few dramatic movements (e.g. the hands might almost never go above
shoulder level).

### Basic step
For my purposes, I define a basic step as
- rhythmically similar to the standard "real moves" of the dance
- the partnership may drift/travel slightly across the floor, but the basic step
  doesn't really go anywhere.
- spatial relationship between partners doesn't change
- connection between partners is present but minimal
- can be used to fill time, e.g. while partners converse

Balboa is the standout here for gold standard basics. There are multiple basics,
they can be layered with complexity while still being basics, that layering can
be done independently by lead and by follow, and they stay interesting for and
are used commonly by even advanced dancers. Take a look at this bullet point
requirement for advanced classes at Calbal:
- "Be able to demonstrate musicality and creativity if asked to dance an entire
  song while only staying in one of the three core Bal basics"
In particular, a lot of the expressiveness in pure bal comes from how each
dancer places their feet onto the floor and picks them up, e.g. with variations
like fans, and that is all available even in simple basics.

Shag likewise has a high-quality basic with lots of footwork variations, though
just one basic(?) (footwork stylings notwithstanding)

Lindy has a serviceable basic (or maybe even a few - six or eight count in open or
closed, allegedly jig walks) which is great for learning, and
enters the mix occassionaly among experienced dancers, but it's not as rich as
for balboa and shag, and you generally wouldn't find experienced dancers
entertaining themselves with long sequences of basics.

Wcs does not have a basic step. It has basic patterns, but those all have
nontrivial leading/following happening, people move along the slot, etc, and
therefore they can't fill the same role of neutral filler material.

Blues kind of also has a basic step, but it's interesting in that there's less
emphasis on "real moves", and so it's not really "basic" in relation to
anything. It is however a high quality basic in the sense that good dancers can
be entertained and expressive without needing to reach for more.


### Pulse
There are some clear differences here, but I mostly don't have much nontrivial
to say about them.
- lindy, bal, shag, blues generally have a pulse
- wcs generally doesn't have a pulse (except as a specific musicality choice a
  few beats at a time)
- the balboa pulse can carry important information in pure bal. for the same
  series of steps/weight transfers, changes in the feel of the pulse through the
  chest connection can indicate what types of step the partner is using
  (plain/fans/digs/etc).
- the blues pulse can be in the hips, especially backwards, while the shoulders
  stay relatively stationary.
- pulses in lindy and blues are generally "down" pulses, in that the downward
  component is faster and emphasized, and the upward component is a more gradual
  recovery. In contrast the pulse in house is more even/symmetric between up and
  down.
- house has "jacking", which is basically a full body pulse. The center of mass
  moves up and down, the hips transcribe an oval (at the high point of the oval,
  hips can be moving forward, backward, left, or right), and the shoulders/torso
  move counter to the hips. The head is not fixed to the torso - rather a
  relaxed neck allows the head to stay relatively calm/in place.


### Lead/follow emphasis
- Blues has pretty low emphasis on lead/follow mechanics, and high emphasis on
  individual movement throughout. E.g. when a turn is lead that in the other
  dances might have an expectation of being a two-count turn, in blues the
  follow might take two counts - or they might take twelve.
- Lindy is pretty heavily lead and followed. Footwork is almost always the
  individual choice of each dancer, through any movement. There are often
  sections where nothing much is being lead, i.e. "solo jazz (by both partners)
  while holding hands", and even breakaways, i.e. "solo jazz (by both partners)
  while not not even holding hands"
- Wcs is both very high and very low here. leading often extends to which
  specific foot the follow is settled into, and which way the torso is angled,
  which are generally not being explictly lead in lindy. However patterns also
  have a "fire and forget" aspect to them, where direction and rotation are set
  up on counts 1 and 2, and then counts 3 and 4 are for the follow to go through
  however they choose, with an expectation of not being disrupted/redirected.
- Shag allegedly has the highest degree of lead-follow, where any arbitrary
  weight shift might be lead at literally any time (though, also true in pure
  bal?)

### Skill requirement
One way to think about this is - if an experienced dancer dances with someone
newer, how much does that latter person need to learn until isn't significantly
disruptive to the former?

From higher/more skill requirement to lower:
- wcs
- pure bal
- lindy, bal-swing
- blues

To some extent, this is the inverse of "lead/follow emphasis", because
individual movement is less impacted by partner skill, while what can be
accomplished through a lead/follow connection depends on the partner.

It's also somewhat inverse of "basic step quality". Pure bal can feel quite
jarring when partners are out of sync, but I count it as more forgiving here
than wcs because having a comfortable basic counts for much more.

### Related dances
- Lindy is the most inter-related of this set of dances. It's rare to go
  somewhere where people are dancing lindy and not also see balboa, shag,
  charleston, and solo jazz being mixed in.
- Wcs doesn't have a "solo wcs" analogue (at least, not to nearly the same
  degree to which solo jazz is a thing), but many individual dancers, especially
  follows, have other solo dance backgrounds that they draw on.
- Charleston is interesting in that it's distinct enough to have its own name
  and history, but it's not distinct enough to have its own competitions,
  events, curriculum. Because it mixes so easily with lindy, charleston gets
  treated as a subset of lindy rather than an independent dance.

### Showiness
- wcs and lindy are on the flashier end of the spectrum. Wcs puts a higher
  proportion of the show into the follow than lindy does. In lindy this is more
  often about footwork, which both dancers can participate in freely (including
  at the same time). In wcs, the big moments are more likely to be something
  related to the upper body, and counterbalanced connections with some
  interesting hold
- in wcs, dancers somewhat regularly mime fragments of lyrics (e.g. point at
  partner when song says something about "you")
- in contrast, balboa, especially pure bal, is relatively more about dancing
  with the partner and less about dancing for an audience. An untrained observer
  watching pure bal might struggle to notice what is even happening.
- this affects what it means to be musical in each dance. In lindy or wcs, this
  is more likely to mean hitting some pose, or layering specific solo movements
  over the partnered baseline. In balboa, it's more likely to be some rythym and
  momentum variation between the partners.
- house dance is visually interesting, but not visually dramatic relative to
  e.g. many choreographed solo dances. For example, the arms may be continually
  in motion (much more so than e.g. arms of partner dancers), but almost never
  rising above the shoulders or hitting particular instants in the music (and
  the music itself is correspondingly more about continuous rythym than sharp
  moments).

## Learning and education
### Partner dancing
#### Group classes
The main thing to say here is that group classes are one of the main ways that
people learn, and group classes are inherently deeply (, deeply, deeply) flawed.
They *are* a way to progress, but a painstakingly inefficient one.

The good thing about group classes is that they provide a little bit of
everything
- people to practice with
- material to learn / curriculum
- feedback

In particular, group classes are the most accessible / lowest-effort way to have
someone to practice with, which is a very important thing. That said...

Feedback: group classes are a garbage source of feedback.
- there is no time to give feedback to partners.
- even if there was time, feedback is *much* less effective when both people
  are learning something new at the same time.
- even if there was good feedback to give and time to give it, the cultural
  convention is strongly against giving feedback in classes.
- feedback from instructors is aimed at the group as a whole, and feedback is
  *much* less effective when it's not personalized.
- feedback from instructors is verbal and visual, and feedback is *much* less
  effective without physically connecting.

Practice: group classes are a garbage source of practice for leaders and for
followers, in overlapping but also distinct ways.

For followers: it's impossible to learn to interpret and respond to how
something is lead when the leader isn't yet capable of leading it. In
particular, because followers have ears, they also know what mini choreo the
teacher is providing, and so classes have the effect of training followers to
fix/overinterpret/anticipate things that are not actually being led - which is a
bad habit that then has to be unlearned(!), often in further group classes(!!!)

For leaders: it's likewise impossible to learn how to communicate something
correctly when the follow can't yet follow the lead honestly (at least it's
pretty widely acknowledged that follows executing the class choreo deprives
leads of the vital feedback that they didn't actually lead the thing).

Also, when social dancing, if something doesn't go as planned, a very important
skill for leading is to smoothly recover and make a different plan that fits
whatever the new situation is. Group classes promote the exact opposite - try to
power through mistakes as if they never happened to keep up with the choreo.
Productive practice with a partner or private lesson would mean working on the
broken foundations before trying to build on top of them.

Material: material in group classes is generally fine. Looking up one of a
million videos on youtube and copying things is often 90% as good though (and
often better, because you can choose what to work on).

##### Alternative??

My thought on a better systemization of practice which doesn't require infinite
money for professional private lessons would be based on a pyrimid of feedback.

I.e., slice the student population into bands as is currently standard. But
then, rather than have students in a given band learn with each other and at the
same time, each student gets 10-minute slots of practice and feedback with a
student one level up in the other role (e.g. a level 1 lead gets feedback for 10
minutes with a level 2 follow, and in that time the focus is 100% on the level 1
student. The level 2 follow then turns around and receives feedback for 10
minutes from a level 3 lead, etc.).

Because there are fewer dancers in each successive slice, each person would
spend more time giving feedback to the level below than receiving feedback from
the level above, e.g. at a 2-1 ratio.

This is somewhat inspired by the insanely popular mini-privates that balhaus
does, but with the multiple levels being a way to scale it further.

#### Independent one-on-one practice
The message that isn't really ever said out loud is that to improve, it's really
useful to find 1-1 practice partners, and it's each individual dancer's
responsibility to find those practice partners themselves. 1-1 practice sessions
are IMO the best time-and-money-efficient way to learn. Some reasons are
- it's possible to give and receive feedback, and then to actually spend time
  iterating on that feedback.
- full control of the pacing. When something is confusing or doesn't work on the
  first couple tries in a class setting, it's mostly just tough luck. When it
  doesn't work in a practice session, it's usually possible to spend some time
  trying things out until it starts to work (which also feels very satisfying).

When finding a practice partner, it's not as simple as "find the most skilled
partner possible". It's actually more important to find someone with compatible
learning goals. In particular, a lead will have a much bigger difference in
their effective skill level between moves they know and moves they don't know,
whereas beyond a certain point follows effectively "know" all the moves. So, if
a lead is working on new vocabulary, it might make sense to practice with a
follow that hasn't yet reached that point, so that both people benefit.

Another great way to balance out move-centric practice is if both partners are
interested in both roles, and can simply take turns leading and following
everything.

### Solo dancing
Learning solo dance is great because
- practicing solo can be very productive (shocking)
- the problems of partner dance group classes don't apply

It's also a great setting to apply the skill of simplifying what the teacher
gives enough to be challenging-but-possible, because simplifying your own
movements doesn't inhibit anyone else.

### Learning multiple dances
Sometimes it can be difficult to know what to work on. A big hammer that can be
used here is to start learning another type of dance, because finding things to
work on is easier as a beginner when the answer is "literally everything".

Learning a second dance is easier than the first, but not monotonically easier.
I would say there are at least three stages, relative to a true beginner
- an initial head start, from already knowing about connection, rythym, how to
  take steps, etc.
- then a penalty, because the specific details of connection, etc. (including
  even the abstractions of how people think about the dance) are actually
  different, and it takes extra time to "unlearn" existing habits. In this
  stage, it can be hard to access more advanced movements, because the mismatch
  in mechanics gets in the way.
- then a boost again afterwards, because many of the more advanced movements can
  be ported over "for free"

Learning a third (fourth, ...) is easier than learning a second, for a specific
reason - "unlearning" effort starts to carry over. E.g.
- someone who dances only lindy hop may have a strong dependency on taking rock
  steps all the time.
- if they then learn wcs, they'll learn how to stretch into the anchor instead
- if they then learn balboa, the anchor won't necessarily carry over to e.g.
  out-and-ins, but not-rock-stepping *will* carry over.

Said a little more generally, one measure of breadth of experience is to ask
"what have you danced *without*?" Have you danced without rock steps? Without
4/4 music? Without an open position? Without a partner?

### Miscellaneous

- It's often difficult to see progress in the very short term (like the past
  week), but so far I've always been able to see substantial improvement looking
  back over a 3 month window.

- Also, some forms of progress are easier to see than others. Learning a specific
  move or variation with a well-known name is one of the easiest forms of progress
  to see, and probably gradual improvements in quality are one of the hardest.
  Sometimes it can be helpful to try to explicitly connect the two, by finding a
  situation where something vague about quality turns into something tangible.

  As a specific example of that, maybe at 130 bpm it's hard for someone to
  really feel their swingout being overly circular, or to be really excited
  about spending time training to make it more linear. But at 200 bpm, that
  circularity might be the difference between being able to do swingouts at all
  or not, and the feedback is much clearer.


## Miscellaneous
- One specific comparison I make is that dancing is completely opposite as an
  activity from climbing. In climbing the fun and interesting part is often
  about being at the limit of what you can do - trying to climb some route ten
  times and then finally getting it on the eleventh, at which point it becomes
  boring and it's time to move on.

  Whereas in dance, the idea is more to be doing things that are easy (for the
  dancers in question), so that creativity and expressiveness can be layered on
  top. If someone leads a complicated turn that "works" one time out of ten,
  then even on that "success" it will feel and look jarring, and it should have
  really just been avoided.
  
- In the rest of the world, you might have a friendly conversation with someone
  you don't know that well, and give a hug to someone that you do. At dance events
  that can be suprisingly backwards - the default interaction is to dance with
  someone, and it's actually exchanging a few words *without* dancing that's a
  sign someone is a good friend.

- I find it interesting that because south bay dancers tend to drive long
  distances to events, they also tend to carpool, and that contributes to people
  getting to know each other better in a way that doesn't happen in some of the
  other local scenes where people might separately take short bus rides.

### Some things I like about dance
I like that at big events, the incredible dancers who win the competitions and
the people who are teaching are very often the same people.

I like the space available for individual expression. One concrete way that I
think about this is that at big events, it's so common to see people on the
social floor who, sure they would lose to all the pros in a competition, but
they are doing a few things that no one else in the room is doing and it looks
so good.

I like learning, I like teaching, and I really like that dance is something
where many or even most people never stop doing doing both. There's always
something new to show or ask a friend about.

I like that, afaik, dance is the only creative endeavor that one can go practice
on a random evening with a hundred strangers. Similarly, it's one of few things
where it is just as natural to perform on a stage as it is to do for fun at home
alone.

# Wrap-up
Thanks for reading! If you know of other writings/discussion on this kind of
topic, especially by people who know more, let me know - I haven't come across
any yet.
